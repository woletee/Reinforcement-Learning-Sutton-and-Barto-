What is Monte Carlo Method 

- Monte carol method are ways of solving the reinforcement learning (RL) problem based on sampling the average returns.
- Here we will define monte carol methods only for episodic tasks to ensure well defined returns.
- That is we assume experience is divided into episodes and those episodes terminate eventually no matter what action is taken.
- Only on the completion of episodes is the policy and the value estimates changed.
