# Chaptr-4 (Dynamic programming

- What is dynamic programming?
- The term dynamic programming refers to collecting of algorithms that can be used to compute optimal policies given the perfect model of the environment as MDP.
- Classical DP algorithms are of limited utility in RL both because of their assumption of a perfect model and their great computational expenses.
