# Chaptr-4 (Dynamic programming

- What is dynamic programming?
- The term dynamic programming refers to collecting of algorithms that can be used to compute optimal policies given the perfect model of the environment as MDP.
- Classical DP algorithms are of limited utility in RL both because of their assumption of a perfect model and their great computational expenses.
- Here we will assume that the environment for MDP is finite (S, A, R and all are finite)
- The key idea of DP and of reinforcement learning is that the environment for MDP is finite and the structure the search for good policies.
- How do you iteratively optimize a policy or a value function by solving subproblems with dynamic programming.
- For the above problem we will assume that the environment the agent is interaction with is a Markov decision process (MDP) on some probabilistic transition.
- we will assume that our agent is interacting with an environment, and it senses its state through a series of measurement at time t3, t4………tn.
