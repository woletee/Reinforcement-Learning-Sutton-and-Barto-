# Chapter-8(Planning and learning with tabular methods)

What do we mean by tabular methods, planning and learning?

- Tabular methods are a particular type of RL approach that uses tables or arrays to store and update values associated with states and actions in a discrete and finite space.
- Planning in the context of RL refers to the process of selecting actions to maximize a cumulative expected rewards while considering the current states and knowledge that the agent has about the environment.
  - Tabular methods for planning and involves creating arrays or tables and then updating the Q values. one of the algorithms used for learning is dynamic programming.
- Learning in the context of RL involves acquiring about the environment and improving the agent's decision-making ability through time.
- One of the algorithms used for learning are SARSA and Q-learning.

Models and Planning
Model based: when we say that an agent has model of the environment, we mean that anything that an agent can use to predict how the environment will respond to its action or to the action the agent has took.
