# Chapter-2 (multi-armed bandit)

- The most important feature that distinguishes Reinforcement learning from other types of learning is that it uses training information that evaluates the actions taken rather than one that instructs which actions to take by giving the correct actions like in supervised learning.
- The above idea is all about the two different types of feedback which are: instructive versus evaluative feedback.
- Instructive feedback is basically independent of the action taken. It tells which actions to take on the other hand evaluative feedback is dependent on the actions, and it evaluates how good the action taken is.
